## --- Day 25: Code Chronicle ---
Out of ideas and time, The Historians agree that they should go back to check the <em>Chief Historian's office</em> one last time, just in case he went back there without you noticing.

When you get there, you are surprised to discover that the door to his office is <em>locked</em>! You can hear someone inside, but knocking yields no response. The locks on this floor are all fancy, expensive, virtual versions of [five-pin tumbler locks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_tumbler_lock), so you contact North Pole security to see if they can help open the door.

Unfortunately, they've lost track of which locks are installed and which keys go with them, so the best they can do is send over <em>schematics of every lock and every key</em> for the floor you're on (your puzzle input).
