## --- Day 24: Crossed Wires ---
You and The Historians arrive at the edge of a [large grove](/2022/day/23) somewhere in the jungle. After the last incident, the Elves installed a small device that monitors the fruit. While The Historians search the grove, one of them asks if you can take a look at the monitoring device; apparently, it's been malfunctioning recently.

The device seems to be trying to produce a number through some boolean logic gates. Each gate has two inputs and one output. The gates all operate on values that are either <em>true</em> (<code>1</code>) or <em>false</em> (<code>0</code>).


 - <code>AND</code> gates output <code>1</code> if <em>both</em> inputs are <code>1</code>; if either input is <code>0</code>, these gates output <code>0</code>.
 - <code>OR</code> gates output <code>1</code> if <em>one or both</em> inputs is <code>1</code>; if both inputs are <code>0</code>, these gates output <code>0</code>.
 - <code>XOR</code> gates output <code>1</code> if the inputs are <em>different</em>; if the inputs are the same, these gates output <code>0</code>.
