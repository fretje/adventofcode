## --- Day 20: Race Condition ---
The Historians are quite pixelated again. This time, a massive, black building looms over you - you're [right outside](/2017/day/24) the CPU!

While The Historians get to work, a nearby program sees that you're idle and challenges you to a <em>race</em>. Apparently, you've arrived just in time for the frequently-held <em>race condition</em> festival!

The race takes place on a particularly long and twisting code path; programs compete to see who can finish in the <em>fewest picoseconds</em>. The winner even gets their very own [mutex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science))!
