## --- Day 23: LAN Party ---
As The Historians wander around a secure area at Easter Bunny HQ, you come across posters for a [LAN party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN_party) scheduled for today! Maybe you can find it; you connect to a nearby [datalink port](/2016/day/9) and download a map of the local network (your puzzle input).

The network map provides a list of every <em>connection between two computers</em>. For example:

<pre>
<code>kh-tc
qp-kh
de-cg
ka-co
yn-aq
qp-ub
cg-tb
vc-aq
tb-ka
wh-tc
yn-cg
